If $n=8$, we might decide to use a ""binary search"" type of strategy: Our first question would be ""\mathbf 4"" and if the hidden number is higher than $4$ we will need one or two additional questions.

Let our second question be ""\mathbf 6"". If the hidden number is still higher than $6$, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between $7$ and $8$.

Thus, our third question will be ""\mathbf 7"" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be $4+6+7={\color{red}\mathbf{17}}$.

We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for $n=8$, by asking ""\mathbf 5"" as our first question.

If we are told that the hidden number is higher than $5$, our second question will be ""\mathbf 7"", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of $5+7={\color{blue}\mathbf{12}}$).

If we are told that the hidden number is lower than $5$, our second question will be ""\mathbf 3"" and if the hidden number is lower than $3$ our third question will be ""\mathbf 1"", giving a total cost of $5+3+1={\color{blue}\mathbf 9}$.

Since ${\color{blue}\mathbf{12}} > {\color{blue}\mathbf 9}$, the worst-case cost for this strategy is ${\color{red}\mathbf{12}}$. That's better than what we achieved previously with the ""binary search"" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.

So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for $n=8$.

Let $C(n)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for $n$, as described above.

Thus $C(1) = 0$, $C(2) = 1$, $C(3) = 2$ and $C(8) = 12$.

Similarly, $C(100) = 400$ and $\sum_{n = 1}^{100} C(n) = 17575$.

Let $S$ denote the sum $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{200000} C(n)$. What is the remainder when $S$ is divided by $5^7$?",53347,"We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ by asking questions.
Each number (question) we ask, has a cost equal to the number asked and we get one of three possible answers:

-  ""Your guess is lower than the hidden number"", or

-  ""Yes, that's it!"", or

-  ""Your guess is higher than the hidden number"".

Given the value of $n$, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible case. E.g.

If $n=3$, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number ""2"". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost $= 2$).

If $n=8$, we might decide to use a ""binary search"" type of strategy: Our first question would be ""$\mathbf 4$"" and if the hidden number is higher than $4$ we will need one or two additional questions.

Let our second question be ""$\mathbf 6$"". If the hidden number is still higher than $6$, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between $7$ and $8$.
